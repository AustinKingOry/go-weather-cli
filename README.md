    - Displays temperature, pressure, humidity, and weather description

    ## Getting Started

    ### Prerequisites

    - Go (version 1.16 or later)
    - An API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)

    ### Installation

        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/AustinKingOry/weather-cli.git

    2. Initialize the Go module:
        ```sh
        go mod init weather-cli
        ```

    3. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` in `main.go` with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap.

    ### Running the Application

    1. Build and run the application:
        ```sh
        go run main.go "CityName"
        ```
